# Course Management (Backend)

## About

This is a a small learning management systen that allows users to create, read, update,
and delete information about courses, instructors, and students. For example, users can
view a complete set of courses, change the name and instructor of a given course, or
delete a course, or create a new course. Users can also see a complete list of students,
inspect which courses a given student is registered with, change the student's name,
register the student with a course, deregister a student from a course, delete a student
or create a new student (and so on).

## Technology

The backend (this repo) is built with Express.js and PostgreSQL. It works with a frontend
written in React JS and styled with Tailwind CSS and daisyUI (a component library that
builds on Tailwind). Frontend repo [here](https://github.com/Justin-K-Ellis/course-management-frontend).
